  problems:
    - rdfs:label: The process of querying the Web for SemLAV takes about ten minutes. It never stops, it would seem. I do not think this is suitable for a browser. Moreover, it would seem that SemLAV retrieves all instances of things like `?x geo:lat ?y`, which is definitely NOT what I am going to try extracting. Only when I get some IRI for ?x I am going to do something like that. The algorithm might be interesting but I am not positive about that.
