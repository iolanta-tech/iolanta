Sometimes, and for some contexts, one facet is more preferable than the other. For instance, if the user opens a [Nanopublication](/reference/np/Nanopublication), it is rather more efficient to present it with the dedicated facet by default rather than the default Properties view. That is what this relation helps to achieve.

Essentially, it defines a Partial Order on the set of Facets.
