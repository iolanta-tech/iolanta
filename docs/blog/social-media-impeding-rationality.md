title: Social media are impeding rationality
description: Social media are poor tools for rational discussion and decision making, probably because these are not goals towards which social networks are incentivized.

I believe that social media, as the primary method of communication between people, does not help them make [decisions rationally](../rational-decisions/), and will try to gather a few indications towards that statement.

-   :astonished:{ .lg .middle } __Information overload__

    ---

    The sheer amount of information a user faces on any social network I've seen and anyone's using, be it :material-facebook: Facebook, :fontawesome-brands-x-twitter: (n√©e :material-twitter: Twitter), is overwhelming. You can never reach the end of the feed even though you spend way too much time reading it.

-   :bubbles:{ .lg .middle } __Bubbles__

    ---

    * To cope with huge volumes of information,
    * and to avoid negative emotion,

    formation of bubbles is hard to avoid.



-   :tired_face:{ .lg .middle } __No reasoning aid__

    ---

    Theoretically, social networks could _help_ promote reasoning in discussions by technical methods:

    * Argument Mapping,
    * Detection of known systematic fallacies,
    * Promotion of certain common arguments the opponents can agree upon,

    but none of that is done, to my current knowledge.

-   :thumbsdown:{ .lg .middle } __Low level of discussions__

    ---

    My personal feeling is that discussions on social media are generally of extremely low quality.

    * People will repeatedly reference statements which long ago have been disproven, and additional effort is required to reiterate on discussing them,
    * Even the simplest, the crudest fallacies like _ad hominem_ are used routinely.


-   :low_battery:{ .lg .middle } __Polarization__

    ---

    All of that seems to radicalize people; persons who seemed to be more or less willing to find a compromise will find themselves much more radical after a few web holy wars.


-   :angry:{ .lg .middle } __Social network is an agent itself__

    ---

    * Attempts to regulate the tone of discussions,
    * or to inject some rationality by slapping COVID or climate change related banners on any post which seems to be touching upon the subject,

    make the social network a privileged actor in all discussions on the platform, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

    * Oftentimes, users don't agree with the actions of the network,
    * And even if they do, they feel annoyed seeing the same stupid banners about vaccination time and again, -- what are you going to try convincing me about next Mr Zuckerberg, that 2 + 2 = 4 or what?
