# `Alt` + `Click` for provenance

## Context

When we see a statement in Iolanta a very basic operation would be to understand where that statement comes from. For instance, if RDFS ontology contains `rdfs:seeAlso` then who said it does? The RDFS itself or it was a mistake from some other source?

## Decision

Call up a screen with provenance information with `Alt` + `Click`.

## Consequences

* Easy and standardized method to obtain provenance
* Compatible with keyboard-only navigation via `Alt` + `Enter`
    * Not conflicting with commonly used shortcuts, like `Ctrl` + `Enter` used to open stuff in a new page
