# Linked Data is about speed of change to knowledge preserving its consistency

## If the knowledge would never change

Then we would have written associations from one dataset to another as a set of Excel tables. But that would be very hard to maintain. Because knowledge changes.

## This is a framework to think about use cases

We can reason about tooling necessary for a particular use case, and use, or not use LD for it.
