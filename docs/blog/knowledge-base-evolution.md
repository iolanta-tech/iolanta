**Knowledge as code** is written in a simple text format in a natural language, potentially with pieces expressed in a formal language.

**Natural language** pieces can be written in Markdown, as a simple and widespread format.

**Formal language** pieces can be written in YAML-LD.

**Generative AI** tools can understand both natural and formal language pieces.

**Deterministic programs** can mostly only understand formal language expressions.

**Evolution of a knowledge base** might start from a bunch of Markdown files with minimal formalization. As soon as clear use cases for formalization emerge, these files can be enriched with formalized content, upon which generalizations and representations might emerge.

Generative AI tools might assist with conversion from natural language to a formal one.
