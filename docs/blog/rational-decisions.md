## Context

When faced with a need to make a decision, a conscious agent might choose one of the following strategies.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-dice-multiple:{ .lg .middle } __Choose randomly__

    ---

    Choose a random alternative and hope for the best. In a population of agents large enough, _someone_ will be lucky enough to survive.

-   :material-content-copy:{ .lg .middle } __Imitate__
    
    ---

    Copy a solution taken by another agent, maybe the leader of the group, maybe someone old enough to have experience in similar predicaments.

-   :material-plus-minus-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Reason__

    ---

    Build a model of the situation and try to _rationally_ deduce the optimal course of action.

## Consequences

<div class="grid" markdown>
<div markdown>
### :heavy_plus_sign: Pro

* Probability for success:
    * **much** higher than for a random choice,
    * **often** higher than for imitation;
* Capable of long term optimization;
* Capable of finding paths on the fitness landscape beyond local optima
</div>
<div markdown>
### :heavy_minus_sign: Contra

* Expensive in terms of time and effort,
    * which leads to inherently _bounded_ rationality,
    * but can be corrected by technology.
</div>
</div>
