# Call Provenance page with …

## Context

If we Alt + Click on a link we should see provenance page for the IRI symbolized by that link, or for a triple associated with it.

### Alternatives

* `[@click=app.goto({argument})]`
  * `…` is the pure IRI,
  * `…` is a combination of the IRI and its triple for provenance purposes,
  * `…` is an ID by which such a combination can be found,
* Individual mechanism per facet
  * Bubble an event, and the first facet capable will handle it (which is way too assuming cooperation, really)
