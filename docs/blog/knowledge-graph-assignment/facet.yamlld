  A Facet is a visualization component that transforms RDF nodes into human-readable formats.
  Facets are the core mechanism by which Iolanta makes Linked Data accessible to users.
  Each facet is designed to handle specific types of RDF nodes and render them appropriately
  for different output formats (terminal, web, etc.).
